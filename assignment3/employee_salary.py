# Simple program to calculate employee salary
"""
Problem statement
The management of Longho Investing Ltd is paying its employees on an hourly basis. 
The base hourly wage is 2000 FCFA.  The normal working hours at Longho Investing 
is 40 hours per week. For any additional hour that the employee works, they get 
a bonus of 100 FCFA. An employee can work for a maximum of 50 hours a week and 
must work for at least one hour every week. 

Task
The management of Longho Investing Ltd has contacted you to help them automate 
the calculation of the salaries for their employees. Write a program to help the 
management of Longho Investing Ltd calculate an employeeâ€™s weekly salary.

There are 10 employees working for Longho Investing Ltd and the management wants
to print the total money that they pay the employees per week (i.e the sum of the
 weekly payments). 
Also present the average salary per employee.
